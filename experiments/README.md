# experiments

Quarantined experiments, demos, and spike scripts.

- What it was: Non-authoritative demo/spike utilities (`mcp_run_demo`, `decision_closure_demo`, ad-hoc eval scripts).
- Why moved: Remove noise from active runtime directories while preserving historical context.
- Removal plan: Remove per-file once no maintenance value remains.
