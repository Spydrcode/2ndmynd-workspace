      "body": "Businesses in this cohort usually show a balanced mix of job sizes, with decisions landing in a predictable window after a quote is sent. Revenue tends to come from a spread of jobs rather than being concentrated in only a few."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Where this business meaningfully differs",
      "body": "This business meaningfully differs from the typical shape in a few areas, which changes how the week feels to run. Compared to a low-pressure operating range, this business is outside the stable zone in: job mix: medium, decision timing: 1 3 days, decision timing: 4 7 days, decision timing: unknown."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Why it likely feels heavy",
      "body": "When decisions stretch, work sits in limbo longer than it should, which adds pressure through follow-up and re-planning. When the mix tilts toward smaller jobs, context switching rises and it gets harder to protect clean blocks of time. When revenue is carried by a small set of jobs, normal timing changes can feel heavier than they should. This snapshot is an outside perspective—use it to find the pressure point that’s worth changing first."

    {
      "heading": "One clear next step",
      "body": "Protect time for follow-up on medium/large quotes so decisions don’t stall. Treat it as a single, decision-first experiment—not a new reporting habit."
