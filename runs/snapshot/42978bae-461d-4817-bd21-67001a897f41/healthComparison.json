    "This check compares the snapshot to a low-pressure operating range, not an ideal target.",
    "Decision timing is outside the stable range, which can quietly add pressure through follow-up loops and re-planning.",
    "Job mix is outside the stable range, which often shows up as context switching and scattered attention.",
    "Revenue concentration is outside the stable range, so a few jobs can carry outsized pressure when they move."
