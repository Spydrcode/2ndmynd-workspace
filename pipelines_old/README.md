# pipelines_old

Legacy pipeline implementations are quarantined here when no longer authoritative.

- What it was: Older orchestration/pipeline variants.
- Why moved/created: Keep the active kernel surface small and explicit.
- Removal plan: Delete once no route/script relies on old pipeline behavior.
