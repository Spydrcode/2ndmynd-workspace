# intelligence_v2_v3

Legacy intelligence orchestration compatibility area.

- What it was: Pre-v4 orchestration stack (v2/v3 decisions, MCP orchestration, compatibility fallbacks).
- Why moved/created: Reserve explicit boundary for older intelligence logic during migration.
- Removal plan: Remove once API/runtime no longer depend on v2/v3 fallback behavior.
