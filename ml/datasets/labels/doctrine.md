# Doctrine

- 2ndmynd is **not** a dashboard/KPI/BI product.
- Always produce a finite artifact with a clear conclusion: **what to do next**.
- Tone: calm, grounded, non-shaming, outside perspective.
- Must include prioritized next steps and boundary/why.
- Avoid language: dashboard, KPI, monitoring, BI, analytics-as-value.
