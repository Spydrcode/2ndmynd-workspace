# 10-Minute Snapshot Walkthrough — Owner Clarity, Not Metrics

## MINUTE 0–1: SETTING CONTEXT

- “This snapshot is a one-page outside perspective on the operational shape in your exports.”
- “It’s not a report card, and it’s not a system you have to keep checking.”
- “We’re looking for where pressure usually comes from, so we can choose one clear decision.”

## MINUTE 1–3: EXPLAIN THE THREE SHAPES

- “This shows the shape of how work flows through the business.”
- “We compare three shapes:
  1) this business,
  2) a typical peer shape,
  3) a healthy operating range.”
- “The healthy range is not a target. It’s a low-pressure operating band.”
- “No judgement here—this is just how the work is currently shaped.”

## MINUTE 3–6: WALK THE THREE VISUALS (IN ORDER)

### 1) Job Value Distribution

- What it shows: “How job sizes are distributed.”
- What not to read into it: “This is not a productivity or margin chart.”
- Example sentence: “If smaller jobs take up a bigger share, the week can feel more fragmented.”

### 2) Decision Lag Shape

- What it shows: “How long it tends to take for quotes to move into a decision.”
- What not to read into it: “This is not a measure of sales skill or effort.”
- Example sentence: “When decisions stretch, follow-up loops quietly add pressure to the calendar.”

### 3) Revenue Concentration

- What it shows: “How much revenue comes from the biggest jobs.”
- What not to read into it: “This is not a growth target or a risk score.”
- Example sentence: “If a few jobs carry a lot of weight, normal timing changes can feel heavier.”

If the client asks “is this good or bad?”:
- “It’s not good or bad. It just tells us where pressure usually comes from.”

## MINUTE 6–8: STABLE RANGE CHECK

- “This is a low-pressure operating range, not a target.”
- “Within range means the shape usually stays stable without constant firefighting.”
- “Borderline means it’s near the edge—small delays or mix shifts can compound quickly.”
- “Outside range means the shape is likely generating pressure even if the team is doing everything ‘right.’”

Example phrasing:
- Within range: “The overall shape is inside a stable band, so pressure is probably coming from execution details.”
- Borderline: “This is close to the stable edge, so small changes can make the week feel different fast.”
- Outside range: “This sits outside a stable band, which usually creates pressure even before we talk about people or effort.”

## MINUTE 8–9: THE DECISION

- Read “One clear next step” verbatim.
- “We only surface one decision because clarity comes from choosing the first lever, not building a list.”
- “We’re not adding a checklist.”

## MINUTE 9–10: CLOSE

Pick one:
- “Do you want help acting on this?”
- “Do you want to sit with this and decide later?”
