# Design Constitution (v1)

## 1. WHAT 2NDMYND IS

2ndmynd is a second-mind system for owner-led businesses.

Its purpose is to reduce decision pressure, not optimize metrics.

Its product output is finite clarity artifacts: a document-like snapshot you can read, discuss, and act on.

## 2. WHAT 2NDMYND IS NOT

- Not a dashboard company.
- Not a KPI or performance tracking tool.
- Not a forecasting engine.
- Not an optimization system.
- Not a replacement for existing tools.

## 3. THE THREE SHAPES (LOCKED CONCEPT)

v1 is built around three reference shapes:

1) **Company Shape** — a bucketed fingerprint computed from exported quotes/invoices.
2) **Typical Peer Shape** — a baseline shape for similar businesses (a cohort baseline).
3) **Healthy Operating Envelope** — a low-pressure operating range (a band, not a point).

There is no single “optimal” shape.

Health is defined as staying within a pressure-reducing range, not maximizing a score.

## 4. ARTIFACT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- One snapshot per run.
- Static visuals only.
- Narrative conclusions.
- One clear decision.
- No live updating.
- No alerts.
- No “keep checking back.”

## 5. AGENT RULES

- Agents never see raw data.
- Agents reason over aggregates only.
- Agents must conclude.
- Agents may not recommend more than ONE decision.

## 6. CHANGE POLICY

- v1 schemas are frozen.
- Changes require new versions (examples):
  - baseline_v2
  - envelope_v2
  - calibration_v2
- No silent behavioral changes.
