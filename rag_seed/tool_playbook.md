# Tool Playbook: Systems That Reduce Owner Burden

**Philosophy**: Tools should reduce friction, not add complexity. Start simple. Measure what changes.

---

## Intake & Booking

### Problem: Phone Tag and Missed Opportunities
**When it's usually missing**: Business relies 100% on phone calls for booking  
**What changes once it exists**: Customers can request service 24/7; owner isn't interrupted during jobs

**Tool Categories**:
- Online booking forms (Calendly, Acuity, Cal.com)
- Simple request forms with photo upload
- Text-based booking via SMS

**Success signal**: Bookings happen outside business hours; fewer "I called but no answer" scenarios

### Problem: Unclear Service Requests
**When it's usually missing**: Every call requires "I need to see it first" trip  
**What changes once it exists**: Photos and details upfront reduce unnecessary site visits

**Tool Categories**:
- Photo upload in booking forms
- Simple intake questions (address, issue description, urgency)

**Success signal**: More accurate estimates; fewer wasted trips

## Follow-Up & Conversion

### Problem: Quotes Sitting Unanswered
**When it's usually missing**: Owner sends quote and hopes customer calls back  
**What changes once it exists**: Gentle systematic reminders increase close rate without feeling pushy

**Tool Categories**:
- CRM with task reminders (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Notion)
- Email/SMS automation (Zapier, simple drip campaigns)
- Aging report (quotes 7+, 14+, 30+ days old)

**Success signal**: Quote-to-close rate improves; fewer quotes "go cold"

### Problem: Leads Falling Through Cracks
**When it's usually missing**: Busy week = forgotten callbacks  
**What changes once it exists**: Every lead has a next action, nothing falls silent

**Tool Categories**:
- Simple CRM or spreadsheet with follow-up dates
- Task management (Trello, Asana, even pen and paper)

**Success signal**: Owner isn't haunted by "I think I forgot to call someone back"

## Cashflow & Billing

### Problem: Invoice Delays and Payment Chasing
**When it's usually missing**: Invoices sent days/weeks after job completion  
**What changes once it exists**: Faster invoicing = faster payment = better cashflow

**Tool Categories**:
- Mobile invoicing (Square, QuickBooks, Wave)
- Automated recurring billing for contracts
- Payment links via text/email

**Success signal**: Days from job completion to payment collected shrinks

### Problem: No Visibility Into What's Owed
**When it's usually missing**: Owner doesn't know how much is outstanding  
**What changes once it exists**: Clear view of unpaid invoices and expected cash

**Tool Categories**:
- Simple accounting software (QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Wave)
- Aging receivables report

**Success signal**: Owner knows expected cash for next 30 days; fewer surprises

---

## Capacity & Scheduling

### Problem: Scattered Jobs = Windshield Time
**When it's usually missing**: Jobs scheduled by request time, not geography  
**What changes once it exists**: More jobs per day; less fuel and drive time

**Tool Categories**:
- Route optimization (manual or tool-assisted)
- Geographic scheduling (batch jobs by neighborhood)

**Success signal**: Jobs per day increases without working longer hours

### Problem: No Pipeline Visibility
**When it's usually missing**: Owner doesn't know what's booked beyond tomorrow  
**What changes once it exists**: Crew knows next week's work; owner can plan capacity

**Tool Categories**:
- Simple calendar or scheduling tool
- Job pipeline view (quoted → scheduled → in progress → completed)

**Success signal**: Less scrambling; crew knows what's next

---

## Reputation & Reviews

### Problem: No Systematic Review Capture
**When it's usually missing**: Owner hopes happy clients leave reviews voluntarily  
**What changes once it exists**: Consistent 5-star reviews accumulate over time

**Tool Categories**:
- Post-job review request (email/text with link)
- Review request templates (simple, friendly ask)

**Success signal**: New reviews appear monthly; star rating improves

### Problem: Reviews Aren't Visible on Website
**When it's usually missing**: Great reviews live only on Google/Yelp  
**What changes once it exists**: Website showcases social proof to new visitors

**Tool Categories**:
- Google Reviews embed
- Testimonial section on homepage
- Simple review widget

**Success signal**: "I saw your reviews" becomes common in new customer conversations

---

## General Principles

1. **Start with one gap, not five**: Fix the biggest friction point first
2. **Measure before and after**: Track a simple metric (close rate, jobs/day, etc.)
3. **Tool ≠ strategy**: A CRM doesn't fix poor follow-up habits—it just makes it visible
4. **Integration > perfection**: Connected tools beat perfect isolated tools
5. **If it's not used weekly, kill it**: Complexity creep is worse than no tool

## Red Flags: When Tools Make Things Worse

- **Too many dashboards**: Owner spends time "checking systems" instead of working
- **Over-automation**: Customers feel they're talking to a robot
- **Abandoned systems**: Paying for tools no one logs into
- **Complexity creep**: Tool requires a manual to use

**Remember**: The best tool is the one that saves time and gets used consistently. Simple beats fancy.
