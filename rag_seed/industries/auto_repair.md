# Industry: Auto Repair

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- Mix of routine maintenance ($80–$300) and repair work ($300–$2,000+)
- Combination of repeat clients and new walk-ins
- Revenue from bay utilization and parts markup
- Diagnostics and labor are primary profit centers
- Seasonal patterns (brakes, tires, AC) drive some work

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Bay capacity mismatch**: Too many cars waiting or bays sitting empty
- **Parts procurement delays**: Waiting for specialty parts extends job timelines
- **Estimate-to-approval lag**: Customer takes days to approve $800 repair
- **Warranty concerns**: Callbacks for "fix didn't work" eat into profits
- **Customer communication**: "When will my car be ready?" phone calls

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need more customers"
- Usually is: Existing customers aren't coming back regularly (no reminder system)
- Owners think: "My techs are slow"
- Usually is: Parts delays or diagnostic re-work add hidden time
- Early warning: Average ticket size declining or bay utilization dropping

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Bays are consistently utilized without cars sitting for days waiting on parts
- Routine maintenance clients return predictably (oil change → inspection → tires)
- Estimates are approved quickly because trust is high
- Most revenue comes from repeat clients, not walk-in unknowns
- Owner isn't constantly checking on job status—system tracks it

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Service history tracking**: Knowing when regular clients are due for maintenance
- **Estimate follow-up**: Gentle reminder if customer hasn't approved in 24–48 hours
- **Parts inventory buffer**: Stocking common items to avoid wait times
- **Text/email updates**: "Your car is ready" without phone tag
- **Bay scheduling visibility**: Knowing which jobs finish when
- **Warranty tracking**: Flagging repeat issues before they become bigger problems
