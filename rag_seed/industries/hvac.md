# HVAC Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- Installation work ($3K–$15K+ per job)
- Emergency repair calls ($200–$800)
- Scheduled maintenance contracts ($150–$400 per visit)
- Mix of 40–60% service/repair, 20–40% installation, 10–20% maintenance
- Revenue often seasonal (summer AC, winter heating)

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Seasonal volatility**: Summer/winter peaks create capacity chaos, off-season creates cash anxiety
- **Quote follow-up leakage**: Installation quotes sit 14–30 days without systematic nudges
- **Parts dependencies**: Jobs stall waiting for specific units or components
- **Technician capacity mismatch**: Too many calls for crew size, or gaps in slow periods
- **Payment timing**: 14–30 day collection cycles for commercial work strain cashflow

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need more leads"
- Usually is: Pending installation quotes from 2 months ago were never followed up
- Owners think: "My techs are slow"
- Usually is: Parts delays or unclear scope at dispatch
- Early warning: Installation quote-to-close rate dropping or quotes aging past 21 days

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Emergency calls and installs are balanced, not all chaos or all waiting
- Maintenance contracts create predictable monthly revenue
- Installs have clear lead time expectations (not "whenever we can get to it")
- Techs know their next 2–3 days of work, not just today
- Owner isn't personally dispatching every call

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Online service booking**: 24/7 request intake without phone tag
- **Installation quote follow-up**: Automated reminders at 7, 14, 21 days
- **Maintenance contract visibility**: Annual or seasonal service reminders
- **Financing options**: Payment plans for $3K+ installs to reduce sticker shock
- **Parts inventory buffer**: Common units/parts on hand to avoid delays
- **Seasonal demand planning**: Booking summer installs in spring

## Seasonality & Patterns
- **Summer peak**: AC failures spike in heat waves, emergency premium pricing
- **Winter surge**: Heating system breakdowns, similar urgency patterns
- **Spring/Fall shoulder seasons**: Ideal for scheduled maintenance and pre-season installs
- **Off-season challenges**: Cash management during slow months, crew utilization
