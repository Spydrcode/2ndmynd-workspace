# Roofing Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Full roof replacement ($8K–$25K+) = age-based or storm damage
- Emergency repairs (leaks, storm damage) $500–$2K, premium pricing
- Inspection and maintenance (rare but growing) $200–$500
- Mix: 70–85% replacement, 10–20% repair, <5% maintenance

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Weather dependency**: Can't work in rain, extreme heat/cold limits crew productivity
- **Multi-day job scheduling**: Need contiguous days, weather changes force reschedule
- **Material price volatility**: Shingle costs fluctuate, quotes can go stale in 30 days
- **Crew safety and liability**: Fall protection, insurance, licensing are non-negotiable
- **Insurance coordination**: Post-storm work involves claim cycles, slower payment

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need more leads"
- Usually is: Storm-damaged quotes from 6 months ago never re-contacted
- Owners think: "My crew is slow"
- Usually is: Waiting for materials or weather windows, not actual work time
- Early warning: Material overage or underage (both waste money or delay jobs)

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Jobs are scheduled around weather forecasts, not just "next available"
- Material orders happen at least 2 days before job start
- Crew knows which jobs are warranty-sensitive vs standard
- Re-roof offers are sent to homeowners with 5-10 year old roofs proactively
- Permit tracking is systematic, not last-minute scramble

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Permit tracking workflow**: Automated reminders for filing and inspection
- **Proactive re-roof outreach**: Target homes with aging roofs before leaks happen
- **Material inventory visibility**: Know what's on hand vs in-transit
- **Weather-based rescheduling**: System to move jobs when forecast changes
- **Warranty documentation**: Track manufacturer certifications and installation dates
- **Financing options**: Payment plans for $10K+ re-roofs reduce sticker shock

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Storm season surge**: Spring/summer storms create backlog, premium pricing
- **Late summer/fall prevention**: Homeowners re-roof before winter
- **Winter slowdown**: Cold weather limits work, revenue drops
- **Insurance claim cycles**: Post-storm work has 30-90 day payment lag
