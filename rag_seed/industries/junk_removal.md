# Junk Removal Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Residential cleanouts (garage, basement, estate) $150–$800 per job
- Commercial cleanouts (office, retail, construction debris) $300–$2K+
- Single-item pickups (appliances, furniture) $75–$200
- Mix: 60–75% residential, 20–30% commercial, 5–10% single items

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Volume estimation difficulty**: Hard to quote sight-unseen, leads to underpricing or overpricing
- **Dump fees volatility**: Landfill costs fluctuate, erode margins on flat-rate pricing
- **Labor intensity**: Heavy lifting, stairs, tight spaces slow jobs, reduce daily capacity
- **Truck capacity limits**: Can only fit so much per trip, second trips cut profitability
- **Weather dependency**: Rain makes outdoor jobs messy, slows crews

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need cheaper dump fees"
- Usually is: Recycling or donation partnerships reduce dump volume (and costs)
- Owners think: "Customers want flat-rate pricing"
- Usually is: Volume-based pricing (1/4 truck, 1/2 truck, full truck) is clear and fair
- Early warning: Jobs consistently taking 2+ hours longer than estimated (pricing or scoping issue)

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Jobs are quoted with photo-based estimates (not blind phone quotes)
- Pricing is volume-based (truck fractions) not flat-rate guesses
- Recycling partnerships reduce dump fees (metals, electronics, furniture)
- Crew knows which items are donation-eligible vs trash (maximizes efficiency)
- Same-day or next-day availability is standard (not week-long waits)

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Photo-based quoting**: Customers send photos for accurate volume estimates
- **Volume-based pricing tiers**: 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, full truck with clear photos of what fits
- **Recycling partner network**: Metal recyclers, donation centers, e-waste facilities
- **Online booking calendar**: Show available same-day or next-day slots
- **Load maximization training**: Crew knows how to Tetris truck for efficiency

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Spring cleaning surge (Mar-May)**: Garage cleanouts, yard waste removal
- **Summer moving season (Jun-Aug)**: Residential moves generate junk volume
- **Fall estate cleanouts (Sep-Nov)**: Downsizing, estate sales create demand
- **Post-holiday lull (Jan-Feb)**: Slowest period, good for equipment maintenance
