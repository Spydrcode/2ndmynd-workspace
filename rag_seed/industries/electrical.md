# Electrical Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Panel upgrades and service upgrades ($2K–$8K)
- Troubleshooting and repairs (outlets, circuits, lighting) $150–$600
- New installation projects (whole-home rewiring, EV chargers, generators)
- Mix: 40–60% service/repair, 30–50% installation, 5–10% maintenance

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Code compliance complexity**: Permits and inspections required for most work
- **Safety liability**: Electrical work carries high risk, insurance is strict
- **Scope uncertainty**: Opening walls often reveals more problems
- **Parts lead times**: Specific panels or EV chargers may have weeks of delay
- **Licensing requirements**: Jurisdictional licensing can limit service area

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "Customers don't want to pay for diagnostics"
- Usually is: Charging upfront diagnostic fee filters serious buyers, improves close rate
- Owners think: "Panel upgrades are too big to sell"
- Usually is: Offering financing makes $5K+ jobs accessible
- Early warning: High quote volume but low close rate (underpriced or unclear scope)

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Diagnostic fees are charged and communicated upfront
- Panel upgrade quotes include inspection time, not just materials + labor
- Jobs have clear permit and inspection timelines (not "we'll figure it out")
- EV charger installs are bundled with panel upgrades when needed
- Generator installs have lead time expectations set at quote (parts + permits)

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Online troubleshooting intake**: Photos of panels, outlets help pre-qualify jobs
- **Permit tracking workflow**: Reminder system for permit filing and inspection scheduling
- **Financing for large projects**: Payment plans for $3K+ panel upgrades, generators
- **Diagnostic fee structure**: Clear upfront charge for troubleshooting time
- **EV charger package pricing**: Panel assessment + charger install bundled

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Summer heat**: AC load trips breakers, drives panel upgrade demand
- **Winter storms**: Power outage anxiety increases generator install quotes
- **Spring home improvement season**: Outdoor lighting, landscape projects
- **No major slow season**: Electrical issues happen year-round
