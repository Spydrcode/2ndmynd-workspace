# Industry: Painter

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- Residential interior/exterior painting ($1,500–$8,000 per job)
- Mix of full-home repaints, room refreshes, and exterior work
- Seasonal: exterior peaks in spring/summer, interior stays steady
- Often 1–3 jobs running concurrently with 3–7 day timelines
- Referrals and curb appeal ("saw your truck") drive new work

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Weather dependency**: Exterior jobs delayed by rain, heat, or humidity
- **Color approval delays**: Waiting for homeowner to pick colors or approve samples
- **Surface prep surprises**: Rot, mold, or bad prior work adds days
- **Crew capacity mismatch**: Too much work for one crew, not enough for two
- **Estimate-to-start lag**: Jobs quoted in March don't start until May

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need better marketing"
- Usually is: Quotes from 2 months ago were never followed up on
- Owners think: "My crew is slow"
- Usually is: Poor surface condition or unclear scope at estimate stage
- Early warning: Jobs sitting in "quoted" status for 30+ days without a nudge

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Pipeline has 2–4 weeks of confirmed work, not just quotes
- Weather delays don't cause cash panic (buffer built in)
- Crew knows next 3 jobs in advance, not day-of scrambling
- Color and scope decisions happen before start date, not during
- Owner isn't constantly re-quoting or adjusting mid-job

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Quote aging report**: Which estimates are 14+ days old and need follow-up
- **Weather contingency planning**: Backup indoor jobs when outdoor work stalls
- **Photo-based estimates**: Reduces surprise conditions discovered on-site
- **Color approval workflow**: Simple way to lock in choices before crew arrives
- **Seasonal pipeline visibility**: Booking exterior work in winter for spring start
- **Referral capture**: Easy way to ask happy clients for word-of-mouth
