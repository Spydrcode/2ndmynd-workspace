# Industry: General Contractor

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- New construction and renovation projects ($10K–$500K+ range)
- Mix of residential and light commercial work
- Project-based revenue with 30–90 day timelines
- Often 20–40% from repeat clients or referrals
- Heavy reliance on permits, inspections, and subcontractor coordination

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Job overlap chaos**: Multiple projects starting or finishing at once
- **Subcontractor scheduling**: Waiting for plumber, electrician, or inspector delays everything
- **Change orders mid-job**: Scope creep without clear pricing adjustment process
- **Cash timing**: Materials paid upfront, invoice paid 30–60 days later
- **Bidding time sink**: Spending hours on quotes that ghost or decline

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need more leads"
- Usually is: Follow-up on pending quotes is weak or nonexistent
- Owners think: "My crew is slow"
- Usually is: Material delays or unclear scope stall progress
- Early warning: Quotes sitting 14+ days without a decision or nudge

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Most jobs are mid-sized and predictable (not all monster custom homes)
- Clear handoff between quote → deposit → schedule → completion
- Invoices go out within days of job completion, not weeks
- Change orders are documented and priced in real time
- Owner isn't constantly playing dispatcher for subs

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Quote follow-up cadence**: Gentle reminders at 7, 14, 21 days
- **Sub scheduling visibility**: Knowing when trades are available before committing dates
- **Photo-based progress updates**: Reduces "drive by to check" trips
- **Change order templates**: Fast pricing for add-ons without mental overhead
- **Simple cashflow view**: Which jobs have deposits, which need final payment
- **Material procurement buffer**: Ordering key items before job starts to avoid delays
