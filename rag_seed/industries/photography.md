# Photography Services Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Wedding photography ($2K–$8K per event)
- Portrait sessions (family, senior, newborn) $300–$800 per session
- Commercial/real estate photography $150–$500 per shoot
- Mix varies by focus: weddings, portraits, commercial, or blend

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Seasonal demand spikes**: Wedding season (May-Oct) creates backlog, winter slows
- **Editing bottleneck**: Shooting is 10-20% of time, editing is 80-90%
- **Client decision fatigue**: "Pick your favorites" delays album delivery for months
- **Pricing transparency**: Customers expect package deals, not line-item menus
- **Equipment costs**: Cameras, lenses, backups are expensive, depreciate fast

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need to shoot more sessions"
- Usually is: Editing backlog is preventing bookings (can't deliver past work on time)
- Owners think: "Clients want unlimited photos"
- Usually is: Curated galleries (50-100 best shots) are more valuable than 500 unedited
- Early warning: Album delivery time stretching beyond 4-6 weeks post-shoot

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Shooting and editing are scheduled together (not reactive backlog)
- Wedding bookings are limited per weekend (not double-booked)
- Packages include fixed photo count (not "unlimited digital files")
- Second shooter or assistant is available for large events (not solo stress)
- Client galleries are delivered within 2-4 weeks (not months)

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Online booking and deposits**: Calendar shows available dates, 25-50% deposit locks booking
- **Editing workflow batching**: Block time for editing, not squeezing between shoots
- **Pre-shoot questionnaires**: Capture must-have shots, family dynamics, timeline
- **Package pricing clarity**: 3-4 fixed packages (not endless customization)
- **Album upsell automation**: Offer print products post-delivery with templates

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Wedding season (May-Oct)**: Peak bookings, highest revenue per event
- **Portrait mini-sessions (Fall)**: Back-to-school, holiday card demand
- **Winter slowdown (Jan-Feb)**: Fewer events, time for marketing and education
- **Spring engagement season (Mar-Apr)**: Couples book weddings for summer/fall
