# Industry: Pest Control

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- Recurring monthly/quarterly service ($40–$120 per visit)
- One-time treatments (ants, roaches, rodents) ($150–$400)
- Termite inspections and treatments ($300–$2,000+)
- Mix of 70–80% recurring contracts, 20–30% one-time calls
- Some seasonality (summer peak for outdoor pests)

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Route efficiency**: Too much drive time between scheduled stops
- **Chemical/supply management**: Running out mid-route or carrying excess
- **Cancellations and holds**: Clients pausing service during slow seasons
- **Re-treatment callbacks**: "Bugs came back" within service window
- **New customer acquisition cost**: High marketing spend to replace churn

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need more new customers"
- Usually is: Existing customer retention is weak (annual churn >20%)
- Owners think: "Pricing is too low"
- Usually is: Route density or service frequency is off
- Early warning: Customer retention rate dropping or re-treatment calls increasing

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Most revenue from recurring contracts, not sporadic emergency calls
- Routes are geographically clustered (neighborhoods, not scattered)
- Clients rarely cancel mid-contract (high satisfaction and trust)
- Re-treatments are rare (effective first-time service)
- Owner has time to focus on growth, not constant re-servicing

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Recurring billing automation**: Clients charged automatically, not invoiced
- **Route optimization by geography**: Scheduling same-day neighborhoods
- **Service history tracking**: When last treated, what products used
- **Customer retention alerts**: Clients at risk of cancellation
- **Re-treatment tracking**: Patterns in callbacks by product or tech
- **Seasonal service reminders**: Proactive outreach for termite season, etc.
