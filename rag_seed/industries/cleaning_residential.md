# Industry: Cleaning (Residential)

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- Recurring cleaning contracts ($100–$300 per visit)
- Mix of weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly schedules
- One-time deep cleans and move-out cleaning ($200–$600)
- Revenue from retention and schedule density, not ticket size
- Referrals and online reviews drive most new bookings

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Scheduling density**: Gaps between jobs waste drive time and revenue
- **Cancellations and no-shows**: Last-minute cancels leave gaps in the day
- **Supply chain**: Running out of products mid-route
- **Team reliability**: Calling in sick disrupts entire day's schedule
- **Pricing consistency**: Undercharging for difficult or large homes

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need more clients"
- Usually is: Churn from existing clients is too high or schedule gaps too wide
- Owners think: "My team is inefficient"
- Usually is: Route planning has too much windshield time between jobs
- Early warning: Average job count per day declining despite same team size

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Most clients are on recurring schedules (not one-off requests)
- Routes are geographically tight (minimal drive time between)
- Clients pay automatically (card-on-file, not chasing invoices)
- Cancellations are rare because clients value the consistency
- Owner has time to onboard new clients, not constantly fill gaps

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Recurring billing automation**: Clients charged without manual invoicing
- **Route optimization**: Scheduling by geography to reduce drive time
- **Cancellation policy**: Clear rules and backup fill-in system
- **Supply inventory tracking**: Knowing when to restock before running out
- **Client retention tracking**: Who hasn't booked in 60+ days (churn risk)
- **Simple referral incentive**: "Refer a friend, get a free clean"
