# Industry: Taco Stand

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- High-volume, low-ticket sales ($8–$15 per customer)
- Revenue from location, timing, and word-of-mouth
- Often 100–300 transactions per day during peak hours
- Cash-heavy business with tight food cost margins (30–40%)
- Weekends and events can be 60–80% of weekly revenue

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Ingredient spoilage**: Prepping too much or too little for uncertain demand
- **Cash management**: Handling large cash volumes and making daily deposits
- **Labor scheduling**: Finding reliable help for peak hours (lunch, dinner, weekends)
- **Permit and location hassles**: Staying compliant with health codes and parking rules
- **Menu complexity**: Too many items slow service and increase waste

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need more foot traffic"
- Usually is: Service speed or menu clarity is losing impatient customers
- Owners think: "I need to expand the menu"
- Usually is: Tight focus on 5–7 core items would increase speed and reduce waste
- Early warning: Food cost percentage climbing or daily cash receipts declining

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Core menu items are consistent and fast to prepare
- Ingredient orders align with weekly demand patterns
- Peak hours have adequate staffing without over-hiring for slow times
- Cash handling is systematic (not stuffed in a drawer until night)
- Owner can step away for a day without chaos

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Daily sales tracking**: Simple log of cash taken, not just "felt busy"
- **Ingredient par levels**: Knowing exactly what to order each week
- **Labor schedule template**: Predictable staffing for peak days/hours
- **Simple POS or cash register**: Reduces errors and speeds transactions
- **Customer flow optimization**: Menu board clarity and ordering setup
- **Event calendar awareness**: Knowing when local events will spike demand
