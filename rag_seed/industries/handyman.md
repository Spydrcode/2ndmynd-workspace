# Industry: Handyman

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- Small repair and improvement jobs ($100–$2,000 range)
- Mix of one-off calls and repeat homeowner clients
- Often 5–15 jobs per week, quick turnaround (same-day or next-day)
- Revenue from volume, not ticket size
- Heavy referral and word-of-mouth driven

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Scheduling Tetris**: Packing 8 small jobs into a day with travel time
- **Scope uncertainty**: "Just a quick look" turns into 3 hours
- **Payment collection**: Cash/check delays or forgotten invoices
- **Tool/material runs**: Discovering mid-job you need something not on the truck
- **Phone tag**: Constant interruptions for booking and questions

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I'm not charging enough"
- Usually is: Too many $150 jobs that take 2+ hours with travel
- Owners think: "I need to work faster"
- Usually is: Job mix has too many scattered, low-margin calls
- Early warning: Average job price dropping or jobs-per-day staying flat despite feeling busier

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Most jobs are in a predictable range ($300–$800)
- Clear "minimum service call" pricing to avoid tiny jobs
- Same-area scheduling reduces windshield time
- Repeat clients book proactively, not reactively
- Owner has time to think, not just react to the phone

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Online booking with photos**: Reduces "I need to see it first" trips
- **Service call minimums**: Clear pricing for small jobs to protect margins
- **Route optimization**: Grouping jobs by geography, not just by time requested
- **Simple invoicing on-site**: Payment captured before leaving, not chased later
- **Repeat client reminders**: "Hey, it's been 6 months since we fixed X"
- **Time tracking per job**: Understanding which job types are actually profitable
