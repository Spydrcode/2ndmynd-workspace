# Real Estate Sales Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Commission on closed transactions (typically 2.5–3% of sale price)
- Average transaction $8K–$15K commission (varies by market)
- No recurring revenue—every deal is new
- Mix: Buyer-side, seller-side, or both (affects lead generation strategy)

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Long sales cycles**: 30–90 days from offer to close (no income until final)
- **Deal fallthrough risk**: Inspections, financing, appraisals can kill deals late
- **Lead generation volatility**: Referrals dry up, paid ads are expensive, open houses are hit-or-miss
- **Commission split**: Brokerage takes 20–40%, limiting take-home
- **Market sensitivity**: Rising rates or economic shifts halt buying activity

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need more leads"
- Usually is: Past clients aren't being nurtured for repeat/referral business
- Owners think: "I should chase every lead"
- Usually is: Qualifying leads upfront saves time on non-serious buyers
- Early warning: Deal pipeline full but nothing closing (inspection/financing issues)

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Active deals are in multiple stages (not all in same phase)
- Past clients get regular touches (market updates, holiday cards, birthday notes)
- Pre-approval is required before showing homes (filters serious buyers)
- Seller leads have clear listing criteria (price range, condition, timeline)
- Owner isn't doing open houses for every listing (time vs. ROI)

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **CRM for past clients**: Automated nurture sequences, anniversary reminders
- **Lead qualification workflow**: Pre-approval check, timeline questions before showing homes
- **Transaction checklist**: Standardized milestones (inspection, appraisal, final walk-through)
- **Market update automation**: Quarterly emails to sphere with hyperlocal data
- **Referral request system**: Systematic asks after successful closings

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Spring buying season (Mar-Jun)**: High inventory, competitive offers
- **Summer steady state**: Families move before school starts
- **Fall slowdown (Oct-Dec)**: Fewer buyers, holidays distract
- **Winter low season (Jan-Feb)**: Serious buyers only, less competition
