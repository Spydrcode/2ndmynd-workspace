# Bookkeeping Services Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Monthly bookkeeping retainers ($300–$800/month per client)
- Catch-up cleanup projects (6-12 months behind) $1K–$5K one-time
- Tax prep coordination or referral fees
- Mix: 70–85% recurring monthly retainers, 10–20% cleanup projects, 5–10% add-ons

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Client procrastination**: Late receipts, missing documents delay month-end close
- **Scope creep**: "Just bookkeeping" becomes tax questions, payroll advice, collections help
- **Software fragmentation**: Clients use different accounting platforms (QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks)
- **Seasonal tax crunch**: Jan-Apr everyone wants catch-up work done "before taxes"
- **Low perceived value**: Clients question monthly fee when "nothing happened this month"

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need to be cheaper to compete"
- Usually is: Underpricing attracts difficult clients who don't value the service
- Owners think: "I should offer payroll too"
- Usually is: Payroll is high-liability, low-margin—better to partner/refer
- Early warning: Client churn after tax season (sign they only valued the tax prep referral)

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Clients submit documents on a schedule (not last-minute scramble)
- Retainer pricing includes buffer for "quick questions" without nickel-and-diming
- Month-end close happens within 5-10 days of month end (not 30 days later)
- Cleanup projects are priced higher than monthly work (compensates for chaos)
- Owner isn't doing data entry—software integration or VA handles it

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Client document portal**: Dropbox, Google Drive, or app for receipt submission
- **Automated reminders**: Nudge clients for missing docs at month-end
- **Standardized pricing tiers**: Clear packages (basic books, books + reports, books + tax coordination)
- **Onboarding checklist**: New clients get software access, document flow, expectations set upfront
- **Cleanup project scoping**: Formula for pricing based on months behind and transaction volume

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Jan-Apr tax crunch**: Catch-up work and year-end close requests surge
- **Summer lull**: Existing clients maintain rhythm, new client acquisition slows
- **Q4 year-end planning**: Clients need projections for tax planning
- **No major revenue drop**: Retainers create stable monthly income
