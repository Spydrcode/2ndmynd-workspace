# Lawn Care Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Weekly/bi-weekly mowing contracts (recurring) $30–$80 per visit
- Spring/fall cleanup projects (one-time) $150–$500
- Fertilization and weed control programs $40–$100 per treatment
- Mix: 60–75% mowing contracts, 15–25% cleanups, 10–15% treatments

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Weather dependency**: Rain delays create schedule backlog, dry spells reduce growth (less frequent mowing)
- **Route efficiency critical**: Scattered customers = windshield time, fuel costs
- **Equipment breakdowns**: Mowers, trimmers fail mid-route, delay entire day
- **Seasonal revenue cliff**: Winter in cold climates = zero mowing income
- **Price pressure**: Customers view mowing as commodity, resist price increases

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need more customers"
- Usually is: Existing routes are geographically scattered, limiting capacity
- Owners think: "Customers cancel because I'm too expensive"
- Usually is: Inconsistent quality or communication (missed weeks without notice)
- Early warning: Mowing frequency dropping from weekly to bi-weekly (growth slows or customer cutback)

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Routes are organized by neighborhood/geography, not signup order
- Mowing contracts renew automatically (not renegotiated every spring)
- Equipment maintenance is scheduled (not reactive breakdowns)
- Spring cleanups are booked in Feb-Mar before rush (not scrambling in April)
- Add-on services (aeration, mulch) are offered proactively, not just when asked

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Route optimization**: Geographic scheduling to minimize drive time
- **Automated contract renewal**: Recurring billing without manual invoicing
- **Weather rescheduling workflow**: System to notify customers of rain delays
- **Equipment maintenance log**: Track hours, schedule service before breakdowns
- **Seasonal service upsell**: Automated offers for aeration, overseeding, cleanup

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Spring surge (Mar-May)**: Cleanup projects, first mows, contract renewals
- **Summer steady state**: Weekly mowing rhythm, consistent revenue
- **Fall cleanup (Sep-Nov)**: Leaf removal, final mows, aeration
- **Winter shutdown (cold climates)**: Zero mowing revenue, cash management critical
