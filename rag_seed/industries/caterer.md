# Catering Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Corporate events (lunches, meetings) $15–$50 per person
- Private events (weddings, parties) $30–$100+ per person
- Recurring corporate contracts (weekly lunch delivery) predictable revenue
- Mix: 40–60% corporate, 30–50% private events, 10–20% recurring contracts

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Lead time volatility**: Last-minute orders disrupt prep schedule, large events need weeks notice
- **Food cost fluctuations**: Protein and produce prices change, quotes can go stale
- **Capacity constraints**: Kitchen size, staff availability limit concurrent events
- **Deposit and payment timing**: Large events need deposits, final payment often 30+ days post-event
- **Dietary restrictions complexity**: Allergies, vegan, gluten-free multiply prep complexity

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need more events"
- Usually is: Recurring corporate contracts from past events were never pursued
- Owners think: "Customers want the cheapest option"
- Usually is: Premium pricing with clear value (local ingredients, custom menus) attracts better clients
- Early warning: High quote volume but low booking rate (underpriced or unclear scope)

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Events are booked at least 2 weeks out (not day-before scrambles)
- Deposits are required for events over $1K (filters serious inquiries)
- Recurring corporate contracts create baseline monthly revenue
- Menu is limited to 3-5 options per category (not infinite customization)
- Prep schedule accounts for dietary restrictions (not last-minute surprises)

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Online event booking**: Calendar shows available dates, deposit payment upfront
- **Menu standardization**: Clear packages (budget, standard, premium) reduce decision fatigue
- **Recurring contract follow-up**: Offer weekly lunch delivery to past corporate clients
- **Dietary restriction intake**: Form captures allergies and preferences at booking
- **Food cost calculator**: Track margins per menu item to avoid money-losing events

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Spring corporate season (Mar-May)**: Meetings, conferences, team lunches
- **Summer wedding surge (Jun-Aug)**: High revenue but intense prep schedules
- **Fall corporate events (Sep-Nov)**: Holiday parties, year-end meetings
- **Winter holiday catering (Dec)**: Peak season, premium pricing for New Year's events
