# Plumbing Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- Emergency repairs (leaks, clogs, burst pipes) = urgent, premium pricing
- Installation projects (water heaters, fixtures, repiping) $1K–$8K
- Maintenance contracts (drain cleaning, water heater checks) less common than HVAC
- Mix: 50–70% service/repair, 20–40% installation, 5–10% maintenance

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Emergency calls disrupt schedule**: Water damage urgency trumps planned jobs
- **Parts availability**: Specific fixtures or pipes may need special order
- **Job scope creep**: "Simple leak" becomes full repipe once walls are open
- **Payment timing on large installs**: 14–30 day collection cycles strain cashflow
- **Permit requirements**: Repiping and major installs need permits, often forgotten

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need more emergency calls"
- Usually is: Installation quotes from months ago never followed up
- Owners think: "Jobs always take longer than expected"
- Usually is: No buffer time for diagnostic surprises (hidden damage, code issues)
- Early warning: Installation quote-to-close rate dropping below 30%

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Emergency calls don't completely derail the day's schedule
- Installation jobs have clear lead times (not "ASAP whenever")
- Parts for common repairs are on truck or available same-day
- Crew knows which jobs are "quick fix" vs "might need more time"
- Owner isn't personally responding to every emergency call

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Online emergency booking**: 24/7 leak/clog request intake
- **Installation quote follow-up**: Reminders at 7, 14, 30 days for water heaters, repiping
- **Parts inventory visibility**: Track what's on trucks vs warehouse
- **Diagnostic photo capture**: Customer sends photos before dispatch to assess urgency
- **Seasonal maintenance reminders**: Water heater checks, drain cleaning offers

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **Winter surge**: Frozen pipes, heater failures create emergency demand
- **Spring/Summer**: Outdoor plumbing projects, irrigation work
- **Holiday periods**: Thanksgiving/Christmas clogged drains (garbage disposals)
- **No true "slow season"**: Plumbing emergencies happen year-round
