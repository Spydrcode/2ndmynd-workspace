# Industry: Solar Sales

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- Residential solar installations ($15K–$50K per deal)
- Commission-based sales with long close cycles (30–90 days)
- Revenue from close rate and deal volume, not hourly work
- Heavy dependency on lead quality and follow-up persistence
- Financing approval and utility interconnection add friction

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Lead quality vs volume**: Buying leads that don't convert wastes time and money
- **Long sales cycles**: Proposals sitting for weeks without decision
- **Financing bottlenecks**: Homeowner credit issues or approval delays
- **Installation delays**: Permit wait times or installer scheduling gaps
- **Competition pressure**: Homeowners getting 3–5 bids before deciding

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need more leads"
- Usually is: Follow-up on existing proposals is inconsistent or too slow
- Owners think: "Pricing is the issue"
- Usually is: Trust-building and education process is weak
- Early warning: Proposal-to-close rate dropping or average time-to-close stretching

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Most leads come from referrals, not cold purchased lists
- Proposals have clear follow-up cadence (3, 7, 14, 30 days)
- Financing pre-qualification happens early, not after design work
- Installation timeline is communicated clearly upfront
- Owner isn't chasing every lead personally—system does first touch

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Proposal aging dashboard**: Which deals are 14+ days old and need a nudge
- **Referral incentive program**: Past customers referring neighbors
- **Financing pre-qualification**: Checking credit before spending hours on design
- **Automated follow-up sequence**: Email/text reminders for pending proposals
- **Installation timeline transparency**: Clear communication on permit and install wait
- **Competitor positioning**: Why your offer is different, not just cheaper
