# Industry: Pool Service

## What Usually Drives Revenue
- Weekly/bi-weekly pool maintenance ($80–$150 per visit)
- Repairs (pump, filter, heater) ($200–$2,000)
- Seasonal opening/closing ($200–$500)
- Chemical sales and equipment upgrades
- Highly recurring: 70–80% from weekly/bi-weekly contracts

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds
- **Route density**: Scattered pools mean high drive time, low revenue per day
- **Equipment failures**: Old pumps and heaters create unpredictable repair work
- **Chemical balancing complexity**: Green pool calls from neglected maintenance
- **Seasonal dropoff**: Winter slowdown in colder climates
- **Weather delays**: Rain or cold disrupts weekly routes

## Common Blind Spots
- Owners think: "I need to raise prices"
- Usually is: Route has too many far-apart stops (windshield time kills margins)
- Owners think: "Customers are price-shopping"
- Usually is: Service quality or consistency isn't differentiated enough
- Early warning: Customer churn increasing or stops-per-day declining

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)
- Routes are geographically tight (same neighborhoods or complexes)
- Most clients are on recurring contracts, not sporadic calls
- Equipment issues are caught during weekly service, not emergency calls
- Seasonal clients (opening/closing) book early and reliably
- Owner isn't personally visiting every pool every week

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)
- **Route optimization**: Scheduling by geography to minimize drive time
- **Recurring billing automation**: Clients charged monthly without manual invoicing
- **Service log with photos**: Documenting conditions during each visit
- **Equipment age tracking**: Proactive replacement before failures
- **Seasonal booking reminders**: Automated outreach for opening/closing
- **Chemical inventory management**: Knowing when to restock supplies
