# Personal Training Industry Baseline

## What Usually Drives Revenue

- One-on-one training sessions ($50–$150 per hour)
- Small group training (2-4 clients) $30–$60 per person per session
- Monthly packages or memberships (4-12 sessions/month)
- Mix: 60–80% recurring packages, 20–40% single sessions or new client trials

## Where Owner Pressure Commonly Builds

- **Client retention challenge**: Clients quit after 3-6 months (results plateau, motivation dips)
- **Schedule density**: Gaps between sessions = lost income (can't fill odd hours)
- **Location dependency**: Studio rental or gym access required, limits flexibility
- **Low perceived value**: Clients view as luxury expense, first to cut in tight months
- **No-shows and cancellations**: Late cancels cost session time without revenue

## Common Blind Spots

- Owners think: "I need more new clients"
- Usually is: Existing clients aren't buying longer-term packages or referring friends
- Owners think: "Clients leave because results stopped"
- Usually is: Lack of programming variety or goal progression (boredom, not plateaus)
- Early warning: Package renewals dropping from 12-session to 4-session (commitment declining)

## Healthy Shape (Not KPIs)

- Clients are on auto-renewing monthly packages (not single-session bookings)
- Schedule is blocked efficiently (morning block, evening block, minimal gaps)
- No-show policy is clear and enforced (charge for <24hr cancels)
- Clients set new goals every 4-6 weeks (progression keeps motivation high)
- Referrals come systematically (not just random word-of-mouth)

## Common Missing Systems (Tool-Agnostic)

- **Online scheduling and payment**: Clients book sessions, autopay packages
- **Cancellation policy enforcement**: <24hr cancels are charged or deducted from package
- **Goal progression tracking**: Every 4-6 weeks, set new measurable targets
- **Referral incentive program**: Free session or discount for successful referrals
- **Package pricing tiers**: 4-session, 8-session, 12-session with bulk discounts

## Seasonality & Patterns

- **New Year surge (Jan-Feb)**: Resolution-driven new clients, high inquiry volume
- **Summer slowdown (Jun-Aug)**: Vacations disrupt routines, retention dips
- **Fall restart (Sep-Oct)**: Back-to-routine mentality, good renewal period
- **Holiday lull (Nov-Dec)**: Clients skip sessions, revenue drops temporarily
