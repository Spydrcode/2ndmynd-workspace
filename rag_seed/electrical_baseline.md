# Electrical Services Industry Baseline

## Typical Service Mix

Electrical contractors typically balance:
- Residential service calls and repairs (30-50%)
- Commercial maintenance and service contracts (20-40%)
- New construction and renovation work (15-30%)
- Panel upgrades and rewiring (10-20%)

## Common Operational Bottlenecks

1. **Permit and Inspection Dependencies**
   - Licensed work requires permits that can delay schedules
   - Inspection wait times vary by jurisdiction

2. **Quote Lag for Large Jobs**
   - Panel upgrades, rewiring, and EV charger installs often have 14-30 day decision cycles
   - Homeowners may get multiple bids

3. **Material Lead Times**
   - Specialty panels, fixtures, and smart home gear can have long lead times
   - Supply chain disruptions affect job schedules

4. **Safety and Compliance Overhead**
   - Code compliance adds complexity and time to quotes
   - Insurance and licensing costs are significant

## Common Missing Tools

1. **Service Request Forms with Photo Upload**
   - Electrical issues benefit from photos for initial assessment
   - Reduces unnecessary truck rolls

2. **Clear Safety and Compliance Messaging**
   - Customers value knowing work is licensed and insured
   - Website should emphasize code compliance and safety

3. **Quote Follow-Up Automation**
   - Large jobs (panel upgrades, whole-home rewiring) need persistent but gentle follow-up
   - 7-day and 14-day reminders increase conversion

4. **Educational Content**
   - Blog posts or FAQs about panel capacity, EV chargers, and smart home wiring build trust
   - Positions contractor as expert

## Calm, Quiet Founder Language

Electrical contractors value:
- Recognition of safety and code compliance as non-negotiable
- Respect for their licensing and expertise
- Tools that reduce admin burden without adding complexity
- Specific suggestions tied to their actual service mix
- Acknowledgment that some work is predictable, some isn't

Avoid:
- Suggesting shortcuts around permits or code compliance
- Implying they're "behind" on technology
- Alarmist language about missed opportunities
- Generic advice that ignores electrical-specific constraints
