# Plumbing Industry Baseline

## Typical Service Mix

Plumbing businesses typically focus on:
- Emergency repair calls (40-60% of revenue)
- Scheduled service and maintenance (20-30%)
- Installation and remodeling work (15-25%)

## Common Operational Bottlenecks

1. **Emergency Call Triage**
   - High mix of urgent work disrupts scheduling
   - True emergencies vs. "can wait" requires experienced dispatch

2. **Quote-to-Job Conversion Lag**
   - Remodel and installation quotes often sit for 14-30 days
   - Homeowners shop around or delay non-urgent work

3. **Material Procurement**
   - Specialty fixtures and parts create job delays
   - Supply chain issues affect timeline predictability

4. **Payment Collection**
   - Emergency work typically paid faster (same-day or within 7 days)
   - Larger jobs may stretch 30+ days without financing

## Common Missing Tools

1. **Clear Emergency vs. Scheduled Booking**
   - Websites need distinct pathways for urgent and planned work
   - After-hours emergency numbers should be prominent

2. **Quote Follow-Up Sequences**
   - Installation and remodel quotes need systematic follow-up
   - Visual mockups or photos can increase conversion

3. **Service History Access**
   - Repeat customers value easy access to past work records
   - Simple portal or email summaries build trust

4. **Financing for Large Jobs**
   - Repiping, water heater replacements, and remodels benefit from payment plans
   - Upfront financing options reduce decision paralysis

## Calm, Quiet Founder Language

Plumbing founders value:
- Acknowledgment of the chaos of emergency work
- Respect for their pricing and service expertise
- Tools that reduce scheduling friction without adding complexity
- Recognition that not all work is predictable
- Specific, actionable suggestions over theory

Avoid:
- Suggesting they're "leaving money on the table"
- Implying their pricing is wrong
- Promising perfect predictability in an unpredictable field
- Generic "improve your website" without specifics
